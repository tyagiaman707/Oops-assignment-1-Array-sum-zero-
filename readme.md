# Array Sum Zero

In this code ,I check if the array contains any zero element. If yes, then I add that element to the result list and return it.
Otherwise,I maintain a HashMap to keep track of the sum of elements encountered so far and their indices. We iterate through the array and at each iteration,
I calculate the sum of elements encountered so far. If the sum is zero, then I add all the elements from the beginning of the array to the current index to
the result list and return it.If no such combination of elements is found whose sum is zero, then I return "No Elements Found!!!".
